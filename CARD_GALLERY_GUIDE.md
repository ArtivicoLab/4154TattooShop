# Card Gallery Guide for Ink 102 Tattoos

## How to Add New Images to Your Interactive Card Deck

### Simple Steps to Add Images:

1. **Prepare Your Images**
   - Use high-quality tattoo photos (JPEG or JPG format works best)
   - Make sure images are at least 800px wide for best quality
   - Keep file sizes under 2MB for fast loading

2. **Name Your Images**
   - Use descriptive names that describe the tattoo style
   - Use hyphens (-) instead of spaces
   - Examples of good names:
     - `colorful-dragon-tattoo.jpg`
     - `black-and-gray-portrait.jpg`
     - `floral-sleeve-design.jpg`
     - `minimalist-geometric.jpg`
     - `traditional-american-style.jpg`

3. **Upload to the Gallery Folder**
   - Navigate to the `images/card-gallery/` folder in your website files
   - Upload your renamed image files to this folder
   - The card deck will automatically detect and load new images!
