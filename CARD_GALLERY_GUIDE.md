## How to Add New Images to Your Interactive Card Deck

### Simple Steps to Add Images:

1. **Prepare Your Images**
   - Use high-quality tattoo photos (JPEG or JPG format works best)
   - Make sure images are at least 800px wide for best quality
   - Keep file sizes under 2MB for fast loading

2. **Name Your Images Properly** 
   ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The filename creates the card title and description automatically!
   
   **✅ DO THIS:**
   - Use descriptive words separated by hyphens (-)
   - Include the tattoo style, subject, and placement
   - Use lowercase letters
   - No spaces or special characters
   
   **❌ DON'T DO THIS:**
   - Generic names like `IMG_1234.jpg` or `photo.png`
   - Names with spaces like `dragon tattoo.jpg`
   - Random names like `untitled.jpg`

   **Perfect Naming Examples:**
   - `traditional-rose-sleeve.jpg` → Creates: "Traditional Rose Sleeve"
   - `watercolor-butterfly-back.jpg` → Creates: "Watercolor Butterfly Back"
   - `geometric-mandala-forearm.jpg` → Creates: "Geometric Mandala Forearm"
   - `realistic-portrait-shoulder.jpg` → Creates: "Realistic Portrait Shoulder"
   - `minimalist-line-mountain.jpg` → Creates: "Minimalist Line Mountain"

3. **Upload to the Gallery Folder**
   - Navigate to the `images/card-gallery/` folder in your website files
   - Upload your renamed image files to this folder
   - The card deck will automatically detect and load new images!

### How the Card Titles Work:

The system automatically creates card titles from your filenames:
- `vibrant-color-masterpiece.jpg` → **"Vibrant Color Masterpiece"**
- `black-gray-artistry.jpg` → **"Black Gray Artistry"**
- `custom-design-work.jpg` → **"Custom Design Work"**

### Current Images in Your Gallery:
